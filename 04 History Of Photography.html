        <h2>history of photography, method of recording the image of an object through the action of light, or related 
            radiation, on a light-sensitive material. The word, derived from the Greek photos (“light”) and graphein 
            (“to draw”), was first used in the 1830s.
            This article treats the historical and aesthetic aspects of still photography. For a discussion of the technical 
            aspects of the medium, see photography, technology of. For a treatment of motion-picture photography, or cinematography, 
            see motion picture, history of, and motion-picture technology.</h2>
        <h2>In the late 1840s every city in the United States had its own “daguerrean artist,” and villages and towns were served by 
            traveling photographers who had fitted up wagons as studios. In New York City alone there were 77 galleries in 1850. Of 
            these, the most celebrated was that of Mathew B. Brady, who began in 1844 to form a “Gallery of Illustrious Americans,”
             a collection of portraits of notables taken by his own and other cameramen. Several of these portraits, including those 
             of Daniel Webster and Edgar Allan Poe, were published by lithography in a folio volume.</h2>
        <br> <h2>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, compact cameras that were capable of making image control decisions on their own
             were introduced. These "point and shoot" cameras calculated shutter speed, aperture, and focus, leaving photographers 
             free to concentrate on composition.

            The automatic cameras became immensely popular with casual photographers. Professionals and serious amateurs continued to prefer to make 
            their own adjustments and enjoyed the image control available with SLR cameras.
            This understanding of photography’s supposed objectivity has dominated evaluations of its role in the arts. In the early part of its history, 
            photography was sometimes belittled as a mechanical art because of its dependence on technology. In truth, however,
             photography is not the automatic process that is implied by the use of a camera. Although the camera usually limits the
              photographer to depicting existing objects rather than imaginary or interpretive views, the skilled photographer can
               introduce creativity into the mechanical reproduction process. The image can be modified by different lenses and filters. 
               The type of sensitive material used to record the image is a further control, and the contrast between highlight and shadow 
               can be changed by variations in development. In printing the negative, the photographer has a wide choice in the physical
                surface of the paper, the tonal contrast, and the image colour. The photographer also may set up a completely artificial 
                scene to photograph.</h2>
